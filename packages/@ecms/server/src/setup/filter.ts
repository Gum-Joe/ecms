/**
 * Logic to handle filtering of competitors!
 * 
 * To generate our SQL query:
 * 1. Run an algorithm to backtrack to the last event in the tree with "discrete" set for its competitors.
 * 	This is the ID we want to use in the join table when joining the lists of competitors with the join table that links competitors to events/groups
 *  - only the event/group with "discrete" should have entires in the competitors-events-groups join table (join table is `join_competitor_events_group`)
 * 2. Extract information about the competitor_settings at each event/group in the tree
 * 3. From that events in the tree, we walk the tree until we get to filters. We apply filters in the order of the tree, so e.g. :
 * 	- We filter events based on setting for group B from those set at group A
 * 	- Say group B has a child C with filters on it as well. C's filters are then applied after B
 * 	- Say group C has an event D with filters on it as well. D's filters are then applied after C.
 * 	- D is an event so nothing left to transverse
 * 	- We then apply any filters provided to our parameters (to support the filter routes which input the parent event/group of the new event/group as the `eventGroupID` param)
 * 4. Return list of competitor IDs from the filters
 * @param eventGroupID ID of event/group to filter from 
 * @param filters Array of filters to apply to the event/group's competitors, in the order to apply them.
 * 	I.e. this assumes the first filter has the `base` property set for its {@link competitor_filters.type}
 * @param knex Knex instance to use for database queries
 * @param teamsMap Map of Team names to team IDs in the DB
 * @see competitor_filters
 * @see filter_types
 * @returns List of competitor IDs that match the filters, which can then be linked to the event/group being setup.
